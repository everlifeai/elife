# Your Everlife.Ai Avatar Node

This is the “server” version of the Everlife.ai avatar. It can run on your desktop or on any VPS.

## Installation & Setup

Setting up a server node is not difficult but requires you to have a little experience in installing packages like NodeJS and Python. If you would like to set up this node [please read these instructions](node.md). For a “click-to-install” version you probably should use [the community node edition](https://github.com/everlifeai/everlife-node-releases/releases/).

## FAQ

* **What ports should I open in my firewall?**

  Typically you will need to open the ports `8191` and `8192`. You can check the exact ports (based on your node number) by running the `--info` command. For example (`./run-mac.sh --info`)

* **How do I purchase an NFT asset**?

  Everlife is one of the first projects to support NFT’s. You can try it out yourself. [Watch this short video to know more](https://fb.watch/5tSQtbVuFI/).
