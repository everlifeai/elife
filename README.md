# Your Everlife.Ai Avatar Node

This is the “server” version of the Everlife.ai avatar. It can run on your desktop or on any VPS.

## Installation & Setup

Setting up a server node is not difficult but requires you to have a little experience in installing packages like NodeJS and Python. If you would like to set up this node [please read these instructions](node.md). For a “click-to-install” version you probably should use [the community node edition](https://github.com/everlifeai/everlife-node-releases/releases/).
