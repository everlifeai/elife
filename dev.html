<h1 id="everlife-node-for-developers">Everlife Node for Developers</h1>
<p>This document contains instructions for developers of Everlife that want
to setup and begin work on the node. For everyone else a far more useful
read would be <a href=node.html>this one</a>.</p>
<h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>
<p>The node runs in a docker container and will self download and install
<code>redis</code> and the core packages.</p>
<h3 id="accessing-private-repositories">Accessing Private Repositories</h3>
<p>Because we have multiple private repositories in
<a href="https://github.com/everlifeai">Everlife</a>, in order to access them we
need to authenticate ourselves.</p>
<p>Needing to authenticate ourselves multiple times for multiple downloads
and updates is tiresome so we use <code>ssh</code> access. If you can access Github-via-ssh
<a href="https://github.com/everlifeai/elife/blob/2280f5ad77622bf362adc8edfc6201fb076aeb71/run.sh#L19">run.sh</a>
will automatically pick up the ssh settings and use them to download the
repositories.</p>
<h3 id="steps-to-deploy">Steps to deploy</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://help.github.com/articles/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/">Set up ssh access to Github</a></li>
<li>Install Docker</li>
<li><code>./run.sh setup</code> &amp;&amp; <code>./run.sh avatar</code></li>
</ul>
<p>And you're good to go!</p>
<h2 id="quickstart">Quickstart</h2>
<pre><code class="sh language-sh">$&gt; run.sh &lt;command&gt;
    where:
        &lt;command&gt; == One of the following:-
           setup : Setup requirements for the avatar to start (docker &amp; node modules)
           avatar: Start the avatar
           enter : Enter running node container to examine and execute commands</code></pre>
<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>Processes are managed by <a href="https://pm2.io/">pm2</a>. The logs for processes
started will be available in the <code>logs</code> directory. They are useful for
debugging/troubleshooting.</p>
<h2 id="package-overview">Package Overview</h2>
<p>This package code will download and manage all the dependencies needed
to run the avatar, install the skills, communicate with the user and so
on.  Configuration, updates, and troubleshooting can all take place from
here.</p>
<p>This package itself can be thought of as the
core of the avatar - it keeps the rest of the avatar (the AI brain, the
immortal feed, the database etc) alive and stable. That is it's main
responsibility (after all - it has to <em>live forever</em>).</p>
<h3 id="package-details">Package Details</h3>
<p><img src="elife.png" alt="Everlife Architecture" /></p>
<p>For this to work, it delegates all other work to different processes
(a.l.a Erlang's supervisor trees).</p>
<p>These core processes include:</p>
<ol>
<li>The Scuttlebot Immortal Feed and Replication</li>
<li>A Database for storing working data</li>
<li>A Work Queue for managing and distributing work (with a worker
pool)</li>
<li>A Skill Manager for installing, running, and managing skills<ul>
<li>Infrastructure Skills (as hub/as host/…)</li>
<li>Worker skills (twitter svc, vanity address, …)</li></ul></li>
<li>A Communication Manager for installing, running, and managing
communication channels<ul>
<li>Telegram channel</li>
<li>Messenger channel</li>
<li>Alexa channel</li>
<li>Web channel</li>
<li>…</li></ul></li>
<li>An AI for understanding and managing user interaction and
strategies for earning<ul>
<li>Cakechat (python with microservices relay…)</li>
<li>…</li></ul></li>
<li>The stellar blockchain interface for payments, receipts, and smart
contracts.</li>
<li>…</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="scaling-out">Scaling Out</h2>
<p>Because all communication happens via microservices in a docker
container, for more advanced uses we can deploy services on multiple
machines and have scale-out.</p>
